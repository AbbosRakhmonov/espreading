              Grief is a natural response to loss. It affects everyone
              differently, but psychologists have identified five common stages
              that many people experience. Understanding these stages can help
              us cope with difficult emotions and support others going through
              tough times.

            >
              The first stage of grief is denial. When faced with a loss, people
              often feel shocked or unable to accept the situation. For example,
              someone might think, "This canâ€™t be happening to me." Denial acts
              as a defense mechanism to protect us from overwhelming emotions.
              It gives the mind time to adjust to the reality of the loss.

              }}
            >
              After denial, people often feel anger. This stage might involve
              blaming others, feeling frustrated or even directing anger at
              oneself. A grieving person might say, "Why did this happen? Itâ€™s
              not fair!" Anger is a way of expressing the pain we feel inside.
              While it can be uncomfortable, it is an important part of the
              healing process.

              }}
            >
              In the bargaining stage, people try to regain control of the
              situation. They may make promises to themselves or a higher power,
              hoping to reverse the loss. For instance, someone might think, "If
              only I had done things differently, this wouldnâ€™t have happened."
              Bargaining reflects our desire to make sense of the loss and find
              a way to ease the pain.

              Depression is often the most challenging stage. During this time,
              people feel deep sadness and may withdraw from others. Thoughts
              like, "I donâ€™t know how to move on," are common. Depression is not
              a sign of weakness but a normal reaction to loss. Acknowledging
              these feelings and seeking support can help people navigate this
              stage.

              }}
            >
              The final stage is acceptance. Here, people begin to come to terms
              with the loss and adjust to their new reality. This does not mean
              they forget their loved one or the loss becomes insignificant.
              Instead, they find ways to move forward, cherishing the memories
              while embracing life again.

              Grief is a personal journey, and not everyone experiences these
              stages in order. Some may revisit stages, and others might skip
              certain stages altogether. It is important to be patient with
              yourself and others during this process. Support from friends,
              family, or counsellors can make a big difference in helping people
              heal.

              By understanding the five stages of grief, we can better manage
              our emotions and help others in times of need. Grieving is not
              about forgetting but learning to live with loss while finding
              strength to move forward.

                misses her, she has started volunteering at a community center,
                inspired by her friendâ€™s love for helping others. She has found

                Emma recently lost her husband in an accident. She often feels
                numb and keeps thinking he will walk through the door any
                minute. She avoids looking at his belongings because it makes
                the situation feel too real.

                Carlos lost his younger sister to illness. He feels frustrated
                and angry at the doctors for not doing enough to save her. He
                also blames himself for not recognizing the severity of her

                After losing her mother, Fatima spends a lot of time wondering
                if she could have prevented it. She often thinks, "If only I had
                encouraged her to see a doctor sooner, maybe she would still be
                alive."
